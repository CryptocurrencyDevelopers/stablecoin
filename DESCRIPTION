Description: Client for accessing and aggregating information on multiple 
    blockchains for stablecoin data and analytics.  This package uses blockchain
    explorer web services as well as analytics APIs to simplify the collection 
    of data on stablecoin circulation of USDC and USDT, currently the two
    stablecoins with the largest outstanding circulation.  Also included are 
    data manipulation and charting helper functions for common analytical 
    approaches to measuring and comparing stablecoin usage over time.
